There was no immediate word on where the two bodies were recovered.\n\nThe evacuation of the Greek ferry that caught fire between Italy and Albania has been completed, with a total of 414 people rescued from the boat, Italian Premier Matteo Renzi said Monday. He added that only the vessel's captain and four Italian sailors remain on board to assist in the operation, and they would remain on the ferry to try to hook it up to a tug boat.\n\nHelicopters defied high winds, stormy seas and darkness to pluck the hundreds of passengers from the ferry as survivors told of a frantic rush to escape the flames and pelting rain.\n\nEarlier, authorities found four bodies in the water and the body of one Greek man was recovered Sunday from a lifeboat chute, the Greek Coast Guard said. Their identities or the circumstances of their deaths were not immediately known.\n\nExhausted and cold, 49 passengers reached land Monday in the southern Italian port of Bari, more than 24 hours after fire broke out on the ferry's car deck after departing the Greek port of Patras en route to Ancona in Italy.\n\nGrazie a chi lavora da ore tra Ravenna e #normanatlantic.L'Italia \u00e8 orgogliosa della vostra tenacia! Sar\u00e0 una lunga notte: intanto grazie!\u2014 Matteo Renzi (@matteorenzi) December 28, 2014\n\nThe Greek and Italian premiers separately expressed their condolences to the victims and gratitude to the rescue workers. Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said the \"massive and unprecedented operation saved the lives of hundreds of passengers following the fire on the ship in the Adriatic Sea -- under the most difficult circumstances,\" while Renzi said the \"impressive\" rescue efforts prevented \"a slaughter at sea.\"\n\nThe ferry company had originally said there were 478 passengers and crew on board the ferry; officials couldn't immediately explain the discrepancy between the numbers.\n\nAccounts emerging Monday painted a picture of a panicked reaction as the fire spread, with passengers choking on the smoke and struggling to figure out how to reach safety as they suffered both searing heat from the ship's floors and driving rain outside. Prosecutors in Bari were opening an investigation into how the fire started.\n\nA Greek truck driver aboard one of the rescue vessels described the rescue scene as \"a chaos, a panic.\" He said the fire alarm came after most passengers, alerted by smoke filling their cabins, had gone outside, and that there was no crew in sight to direct passengers.\n\n\"Our feet were burning and from the feet up we were soaked,\" Christos Perlis, 32, told the AP via telephone.\n\nWhen rescue helicopters arrived, Perlis said passengers began to panic.\n\n\"Everyone there was trampling on each other to get onto the helicopter,\" said Perlis, who said he and another man tried to impose order.\n\n\"First children, then women and then men.

Pray hard.\"\n\nTo all my staff Airasia all stars be strong, continue to be the best. Pray hard. Continue to do your best for all our guests. See u all soon\u2014 Tony Fernandes (@tonyfernandes) December 28, 2014\n\nIn an age when many corporate leaders are insulated from their customers and staff, the Malaysian-born, British-educated Fernandes is a vocal leader who enjoys interacting with the public, at airports and on social media. AirAsia passengers often tweet him photos of their vacations, which Fernandes then shares with his followers.\n\nHe's posed for photos with Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao and hosted Asia's version of the reality TV show \"The Apprentice.\" And he has a personal credo: \"Believe the unbelievable. Dream the impossible. Never take no for an answer.\"\n\nFernandes' reach extends well beyond airlines. In 2011, he bought a majority stake in the English Premier League club Queens Park Rangers. He is often seen in the soccer team's blue-and-white jersey, which bears AirAsia's name in bold red across the front.\n\nHe also has funded a Formula One racing team, making lavish bets with owners of competing teams.\n\nBut his heart remains in travel.\n\nFernandes, 50, pioneered low-cost air travel in Southeast Asia, opening up skies previously dominated by full-service carriers like Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways. In 2001, he resigned as vice president for Southeast Asia at Warner Music to enter the airline business, a longtime dream.\n\nWith some business partners, he bought struggling AirAsia and its two planes for just 26 cents and assumed its $11.4 million in debt.\n\nHe was, in many ways, ahead of the industry curve: He sensed a need for low-cost flights to serve a quickly growing middle class in what's now the world's fastest-growing region for airlines.\n\nThe International Air Transport Association predicts that routes to, from and within the Asia-Pacific region will carry an additional 1.8 billion annual passengers by 2034, for an overall market size of 2.9 billion. Within two decades, the region is expected to account for 42% of global passenger traffic.\n\n\"Air travel is made for Asia,\" Fernandes told The Associated Press in 2002. \"You can generally drive from one end of Europe to another or take a train, but that's not the case here. You want to try driving from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok? Good luck, mate!\"\n\nIn some ways, Fernandes' career echoes the empire Richard Branson created with his Virgin Group. (Fernandes once worked as an accountant for Branson's company.)\n\nAirAsia has expanded beyond Malaysia with affiliates in Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and India, as well as a long-distance airline, AirAsia X. The airline has looked for ways to expand air travel quickly, including planning a monthly pass available beginning in January that is good for 10 destinations a month.\n\nFernandes has also launched the no-frills Tune Hotels and a mobile phone company and financial services arm, just as Virgin did.\n\nThere was even one time when Fernandes beat Branson -- well, actually his Formula One racing team finished two spots ahead of Branson's. The two businessmen had placed a wager on the race. And in May 2013, it was time for Branson to pay up.\n\nBranson had his legs shaved, put on lipstick and squeezed into a red skirt to serve as a flight attendant on an AirAsia flight from Perth, Australia, to Malaysia. In a possible act of revenge, he spilled orange juice on Fernandes, a passenger on the trip.\n\n\"He looked at me, I said, 'Don't you dare,' and the next thing I know, he tipped the whole tray on me,'\" Fernandes told the AP at the time. \"I was walking around the flight in my underwear for a while because I didn't bring another pair of trousers.\"\n\nFernandes has had his own share of mishaps.\n\nOn the day Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 went missing, Fernandes said on Twitter that the aircraft's radio had failed but that the plane landed and all were safe. He later deleted the tweet. That plane still hasn't been found.\n\nA few weeks later, AirAsia had to pull its inflight magazine for an article boasting that its well-trained pilots would never lose a plane. The magazine was printed before Flight 370 disappeared. But it was a painful poke for a country reeling from the loss.\n\nNow, Fernandes must find the right thing to say as his own plane is lost at sea.\n\nAdditional reporting by Mashable\n\nHave something to add to this story?

You're not alone: Each year at CorpNet we see an uptick of new businesses formed in January. The New Year marks a new beginning, and what can be more fulfilling and exciting than making things happen with your own business? \n\nAs a serial entrepreneur myself, I wouldn't trade the opportunities and exhilaration for anything in the world, but I also realize that launching and running a business isn't for everyone. While you can't prepare yourself for every aspect of the entrepreneurial lifestyle, here are six important questions to ask before you quit your day job and dive in: \n\n1. What's your motivation? \n\nPeople are drawn to start their own business for a variety of business. Some hate having a boss, are tired of the morning commute, and feel they can do it better on their own. Others want to see the startup riches: get sold to Google, get tons of cash and retire early. \n\nSee also: 5 advisers to avoid when launching a startup\n\nThe problem is that wanting to be the boss or make lots of money generally aren't viable reasons for launching a business. A true entrepreneur starts a business in order to improve people's lives and contribute value to the world. What's your business idea? Are you solving a common pain point or making someone's day better? The drive to add value will sustain you when times are tough. \n\n2. How developed is your business savvy?\n\nA great product idea isn't always enough to make a great business. I have seen countless examples where a brilliant \u201cinventor,\u201d such as a developer or artist, focuses on building the prototype or product and forgets about all other aspects of developing a business. Just because you develop something cool doesn't mean that customers will instantly bang down your door to buy. Entrepreneurs get that. \n\nIf you think you are more of an inventor than an entrepreneur, don't worry. This doesn't mean you shouldn't start your own business, but you should look for a partner with the right entrepreneurial skills and business acumen that can help turn your idea into a thriving business. \n\n3. How thick is your skin? \n\nWhen you are passionate about what you do, it is hard not to take criticism personally. And yes, it sucks to get a bad press review, rejection from an incubator program or negative feedback from customers. However, bad news and rejection are part of the game, and you can't afford to dwell on the negative or take anything personally. \n\nAs much as possible, remove your emotion from each situation. Assess the bad news objectively. In many cases, a critique or bad news offers an important lesson on how to tweak your product, improve your pitch or bump up your customer service in order to succeed.\n\n4. Do things need to be perfect?\n\nIf you tend to be a perfectionist, your biggest challenges will be learning to let go and taming the inner critic. Whether you are launching a product, app, website or blog, if you wait for perfection, you'll never get out of the starting gate. Once you have gotten something to 80% or 90%, it's go time. \n\nThink about the posters on Facebook's walls that say, \"Done is better than perfect.\" They're not encouraging people to be mediocre, but rather to put their stuff out there for the world to see. You should always strive for the highest quality possible, but just remember that in business, like in life, things get messy, and not everything will be perfect. Waiting for perfection is always the enemy of progress. \n\n5. Are you willing to get your hands dirty?\n\nWhen you work at a company, you can call someone else when your email isn't working, you run out of printer ink or you need to set up a customer event. However, in the very early stages of your startup, you will typically need to handle most of these activities yourself, from tech support to sales to IT.  \n\nSee also: 7 Tips for Balancing College with Your Startup Dreams\n\nBefore setting off on your own, make sure you'll be comfortable handling a variety of functions, including the less glamorous ones. Then, as you build your business, be on the lookout for the right opportunities to offload some of these tasks to an employee or service provider. \n\n6. What's your financial situation?\n\nDepending on your business type, it can realistically take anywhere from six months to six years to build out your business, gain traction and turn a profit. You need to ask yourself if you have both the patience and financial situation to weather this kind of time frame.\n\nIn many cases, the best time to lay the groundwork for your startup is when you're working at another job and have some kind of income coming in. When you're getting a steady paycheck from another source, you have the freedom to experiment and build out your product before going solo.\n\nYou can't prepare yourself for every aspect of launching a business, but asking yourself these questions upfront can help you objectively assess how prepared you are to handle the ups and downs of entrepreneurship. Don't let a question or two scare you away from following your dreams, but be honest and take those extra steps to address where you're coming up short."},"shares":{"twitter":1182,"facebook":83,"google_plus":12,"total":1277},"comments_count":0,"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI5LzgwL1F1ZXN0aW9uc2ZvLjRiMWNlLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/0ae9b33d/71f/Questions-for-Starting-Business-2015.jpg","feature_image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI5LzgwL1F1ZXN0aW9uc2ZvLjRiMWNlLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE0Mzh4CmUJanBn/54341794/71f/Questions-for-Starting-Business-2015.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI5LzgwL1F1ZXN0aW9uc2ZvLjRiMWNlLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE3NXgxNzUjCmUJanBn/916cb7cf/71f/Questions-for-Starting-Business-2015.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI5LzgwL1F1ZXN0aW9uc2ZvLjRiMWNlLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1MHgzNTAjCmUJanBn/84be452d/71f/Questions-for-Starting-Business-2015.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI5LzgwL1F1ZXN0aW9uc2ZvLjRiMWNlLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTgweDgwIwplCWpwZw/9ecd0d68/71f/Questions-for-Starting-Business-2015.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI5LzgwL1F1ZXN0aW9uc2ZvLjRiMWNlLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE2MHgxNjAjCmUJanBn/ef3f1690/71f/Questions-for-Starting-Business-2015.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://on.mash.to/1A4jvss","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-slug":"worst-startup-advisers"},{"data-slug":"college-startup-balance"}]},"excerpt":"Before you open your doors, you should ask yourself these important things.

The investigation targeted firearms that were being sold in New York that had been purchased in the Atlanta area.\n\nAuthorities looked at Henry's cellphone, airport surveillance footage and security records and determined that he conspired with Harvey to get the guns past security. Cellphone records showed the two had communicated via text message 12 times shortly before Harvey's flight departed Atlanta for New York City on Dec. 10.\n\nWhen Henry was arrested, authorities confiscated a backpack that contained a smaller bag with 18 handguns inside. Henry told investigators he traveled from Atlanta to New York with the guns and ammunition in his carry-on bag, which would not have made it past TSA screening.\n\nInvestigators said Harvey was assigned to work in the baggage transfer room at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, which is within a designated secure area. Investigators said security records show Harvey used his employee access card to enter the secure area just before 7 a.m. the day of Henry's flight to New York.\n\nInvestigators said security footage showed Henry carrying a backpack and walking toward a gate in the B concourse around the same time he began texting Harvey. Harvey later entered a men's restroom across from the gate where Henry was waiting, and security footage recorded Henry walk into the same restroom soon after. A minute later, Henry walked back out carrying the backpack where the guns were later found.\n\nHenry later traveled to the A concourse and flight records show he departed from gate A1, investigators said in the affidavit.\n\nFederal authorities accuse Henry and Harvey of conspiring to smuggle guns through the airport several times. Between May and Dec. 10, Henry supplied 129 handguns and assault rifles to a co-conspirator who then made sales to an undercover officer, according to the affidavit.\n\nHenry, a former baggage handler and ramp agent, was fired from the airline for abusing its buddy pass system. He used pass benefits belonging to his mother, a retired Delta gate agent, to arrange for the flight between Atlanta and New York, according to the affidavit.\n\n\"Delta is cooperating with authorities in this investigation. We take seriously any activity that fails to uphold our strict commitment to the safety and security of our customers and employees,\" airline spokesman Morgan Durrant said in an emailed statement.\n\nIt's unclear whether Harvey has an attorney.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Pinterest claims the average promoted pins is shared 11 times, on average, meaning advertisers got about a 30% bump in earned media for their campaigns.\n\nLike other Pinterest content, promoted pins also have a long tail, Bradford. She added that promoted Pins got a 5% increase in earned media a month after a campaign ended.\n\nIn allowing for greater monetization of its platform, which is now used by about 70 million people globally, Pinterest may begin justifying its $5 billion valuation. The company, which was founded in March 2010, has received more than $760 million in venture capital to date.\n\nPinterest, however, vies with other social media outlets, including Facebook and Twitter, for the same advertising dollars.

A night in which we hope we will be able to rescue all on board,\" Greek Merchant Marine Minister Miltiadis Varvitsiotis said in Athens.\n\nHe said 10 merchant ships were in the area assisting rescue efforts, and that those who had already taken on dozens of passengers from the stricken ferry would remain in the area until the operation was over. Only then would it be determined where they would go, Varvitsiotis said. He added that the fire seemed to be somewhat under control, and that the ship would be towed to Italy, Reuters reported.\n\nThe fire broke out before dawn Sunday on a car deck of the Italian-flagged Norman Atlantic, traveling from the western Greek port of Patras to the Italian port of Ancona on the Adriatic, with 422 passengers and 56 crew members on board.\n\nItaly and Greece sent navy and coast guard vessels and helicopters, while nearby merchant ships lined up to form a barrier to protect the ferry from towering waves, and to facilitate rescue. As darkness fell, Italian Defense Minister Roberta Pinotti said rescue operations would continue through the night. \n\n#BREAKING #NormanAtlantic rescue: Italian Navy's ship Lpd San Giorgio #MarinaMilitare takes the command of the operation rescue\u2014 Marina Militare (@ItalianNavy) December 28, 2014\n\nVarvitsiotis described the efforts as \"one of the most complex search and rescue operations we have dealt with in recent years.\"\n\nMost of those rescued were transported to other nearby ships, but nine were taken to the Italian town of Lecce. Of those, three children and a pregnant woman were being treated for hypothermia in a local hospital. Dr. Raffaele Montinaro said the children were in \"excellent\" condition, and emergency room doctor Antonio Palumbo said the mother's condition was also good.\n\nThe Italian Navy said the man who died and one injured person were transported by helicopter to the southern Italian city of Brindisi. It was unclear how the death or injury occurred, but the Greek Coast Guard said the pair were found in a lifeboat rescue chute.\n\nThe second injury was to a member of the Italian military involved in the rescue operation, Coast Guard Admiral Giovanni Pettorino said.\n\nPettorino told Italy's Sky TG24 TV that two Italian tugs tried to attach themselves to the ferry in the evening, but failed because the smoke was too strong.\n\nThick smoke engulfed the ferry, and passengers still on board said the ship had begun to list to one side.\n\n\"There's a lot of smoke, we can't breathe,\" passenger Nikos Papatheodosiou told Greece's state-run Nerit television as darkness fell. \"Panic, there's panic,\" he said.\n\nPassengers described scenes of terror and chaos when the fire broke out, as they slept in their cabins.\n\n\"They called first on women and children to be evacuated from the ship,\" Vassiliki Tavrizelou, who was rescued along with her 2-year-old daughter, said.\n\n\"Ships could not approach us because of the rain and winds,\" Tavrizelou said in a telephone interview from Lecce. \"We were at least four hours on the deck, in the cold and rain.\"\n\nShe recalled the ship alarm going off, and seeing fire from her cabin. \"Then we heard explosions,\" Tavrizelou said. It was not immediately clear what the explosions were, and the cause of the fire has yet to be determined.\n\nPassenger Giorgos Stiliaras told Greek Mega TV that passengers were having trouble breathing with all the smoke. \n\n\"We are outside, we are very cold, the ship is full of smoke,\" he said by telephone. \"The boat is still burning, the floors are boiling.\" \n\nHe recalled people being awakened by \"the smell of burning plastic.\"\n\nThe ship, run by a Greek ferry company, was packed with holidaymakers and truck drivers making the popular transport run between Greece and Italy. Of those on board, 234 passengers and 34 crew are Greek, according to Greek Merchant Marine spokesperson Nikos Lagadianos.\n\nOther passengers are from Turkey, Albania, Italy and several other countries, including Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and France. The crew are Greek and Italian.\n\nGreek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras was in contact with his Italian counterpart, Matteo Renzi, to coordinate the operation.\n\nMerchant Marine Minister Varvitsiotis said the Coast Guard was in constant contact with Italian authorities and the Greek armed forces. \"We are committed to rescuing everyone on the ship, and are trying to ensure that nobody will be left unaided,\" he said.\n\nIn a separate naval incident, a Turkish cargo ship collided with another merchant vessel, and sank near a foggy Italian port in the northern Adriatic, killing two crew members and leaving four others missing in cold, rough seas, Italian officials said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Mashable\n\nHave something to add to this story?

De Blasio has been unable to finalize contracts with police unions, leading to drawn-out and bitter negotiations. \n\nMeanwhile, tensions between de Blasio and the NYPD worsened following the killing of two officers by a man who claimed on social media to be motivated by the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown. Patrick Lynch, head of a major police union known as the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said the mayor and others who had been critical of the NYPD were at fault. Some members of the police department turned their backs on de Blasio while he spoke Satruday at a funeral for Rafael Ramos, one of the officers killed in the Dec. 20 shooting. \n\nBratton also discussed on Sunday the broader problems that contributed to the tension. \n\n\"This isn\u2019t just about policing. This goes to much larger issues. We\u2019re the tip of the iceberg,\" he said. \"This is about the continuing poverty rates, the continuing, growing disparity between the wealthy and the poor. It's still about employment issues. There's so many national issues that need to be addressed.\"\n\nDe Blasio had already drawn the ire of the NYPD even before taking office, having run on a platform that included police reform. He further stoked controversy when he reportedly told his son Dante, who is half African-American, that he must be careful around police due to the color of his skin. \n\nTwo separate incidents, in which white police officers were not indicted in the killings of unarmed black men, sparked a wave of anti-police brutality protests across the U.S. Earlier this month, a Staten Island grand jury did not indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo in the chokehold killing of Eric Garner. And just a week before that decision, a Missouri grand jury did not indict former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Buses and taxis are equipped with routers that serve as mobile Wi-Fi hot spots for tens of thousands of riders. The routers also collect data from the vehicles -- and from sensors on trash bins around the city -- and relay it back to city offices to help with civic planning.\n\nMore than 600 buses and taxis are part of the network, which is now serving 70,000 people a month and absorbing between 50 and 80 percent of wireless traffic from users who otherwise would have had to use the cellular network. Built by a startup called Veniam, spun out of the University of Porto, it is the largest and most sophisticated vehicle-based network in the world, the company says.\n\nIn addition to supplying Internet access, the Porto network is being used to collect sensor data. When buses and taxis hit a sharp bump that might be due to a pothole, the suspension sensors detect this and relay the information to City Hall to help identify where roads need repairs. Waste containers equipped with sensors use the network to relay whether they are full, so they can be picked up at the most efficient times.\n\nThe company recently got $4.2 million in venture funding and set up its headquarters in Mountain View, California. Founder Joao Barros, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Porto, says it plans to expand service to other cities."},"shares":{"twitter":1457,"facebook":462,"google_plus":102,"total":2021},"comments_count":0,"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI4L2VmL1ZlbmlhbV8zLmI4MGJiLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/f38baffa/960/Veniam_3.jpg","feature_image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI4L2VmL1ZlbmlhbV8zLmI4MGJiLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE0Mzh4CmUJanBn/2aaf16e9/960/Veniam_3.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI4L2VmL1ZlbmlhbV8zLmI4MGJiLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1NngyMDUjCmUJanBn/8a6b1dc9/960/Veniam_3.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI4L2VmL1ZlbmlhbV8zLmI4MGJiLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTcxMng0MTAjCmUJanBn/1f4f80fb/960/Veniam_3.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI4L2VmL1ZlbmlhbV8zLmI4MGJiLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTI4MHgxNTcjCmUJanBn/de421a26/960/Veniam_3.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI4L2VmL1ZlbmlhbV8zLmI4MGJiLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTU2MHgzMTQjCmUJanBn/e201f580/960/Veniam_3.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://on.mash.to/1ExRVcH","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"velocity":[753,753,752,752,751,751,751,750,750,750,749,749,749,748,748,748,747,747,746,746,746,745,745,746,748,749,750,751,752,754,755,756,757,759,760,761,762,764,765,766,767,769,770,771,773,774,775,777,778,780],"show_sponsorship":true,"channel":"Tech","channel_link":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://mashable.com/tech/"},{"_id":"54a00d1112d2cd421800c716","id":"2014/12/28/diy-indoor-camping","title":"11 DIY ways to camp indoors when the weather outside is frightful","title_tag":null,"author":"Andrea Romano","post_date":"2014-12-28T14:00:44+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sun, 28 Dec 2014 14:00:44 +0000","sort_key":"1y5f0L","link":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://mashable.com/2014/12/28/diy-indoor-camping/","content":{"plain":"Baby, it's cold outside, so let's make s'mores.\n\nCamping doesn't need to be a summer-only activity.

Over the years, Rex brought the Jets a bold confidence and a couple of great post-season runs, which all of us will remember.\n\nI am beginning our search for new football leadership, effective immediately, with guidance and support from respected football experts, including Charley Casserly and Ron Wolf, two Super Bowl winners with decades of valuable experience.\n\nWe will consider all options to improve the Jets.\n\nSome information in this report was provided by The Associated Press"},"shares":{"facebook":82,"twitter":1273,"google_plus":2,"total":1357},"comments_count":0,"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI5LzE5L0pldHMuMThjMTUuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJOTUweDUzNCMKZQlqcGc/e7e55934/6fe/Jets.jpg","feature_image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI5LzE5L0pldHMuMThjMTUuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJMTQzOHgKZQlqcGc/93be05b5/6fe/Jets.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI5LzE5L0pldHMuMThjMTUuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJNjM4eDM2OCMKZQlqcGc/986d5211/6fe/Jets.jpg","query":true,"size":"638x368#"},{"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI5LzE5L0pldHMuMThjMTUuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJMTI3Nng3MzYjCmUJanBn/b277bab0/6fe/Jets.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1276x736#"},{"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI5LzE5L0pldHMuMThjMTUuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJMzU2eDIwNSMKZQlqcGc/5d8a8945/6fe/Jets.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px)","size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI5LzE5L0pldHMuMThjMTUuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJNzEyeDQxMCMKZQlqcGc/f0d383c0/6fe/Jets.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI5LzE5L0pldHMuMThjMTUuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJMjgweDE1NyMKZQlqcGc/dbd03ebc/6fe/Jets.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzI5LzE5L0pldHMuMThjMTUuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJNTYweDMxNCMKZQlqcGc/3912d393/6fe/Jets.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://on.mash.to/1wXg5bz","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"New York Jets head coach Rex Ryan will not be returning for another season with the NFL team.","show_sponsorship":true,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_link":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://mashable.com/entertainment/"},{"_id":"54a148ec97b2f84830001605","id":"2014/12/29/uk-cold-weather","title":"Temperatures plummet across the UK amid warnings of ice and snow","title_tag":null,"author":"Tim Chester","post_date":"2014-12-29T12:28:18+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 29 Dec 2014 12:28:18 +0000","sort_key":"1y5Aah","link":"https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153334/http://mashable.com/2014/12/29/uk-cold-weather/","content":{"plain":"LONDON -- The year might be almost over, but last night temperatures dropped to a 2014 low across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nSee also: The extreme weather and climate events of 2014 in 13 photos\n\nTemperatures were compared to Alaska and Iceland Monday morning as newspapers attempted to contextualise mercury readings that plummeted to minus 8.8 degrees Centigrade (16.2F) in Katesbridge, County Down, minus 7.6 degrees Centigrade in parts of England and minus 6.7 degrees Centigrade in Wales.\n\nColdest night of the year so far for England (Benson -7.6C), Wales (Pembrey Sands -6.7C) & NI (Katesbridge -8.8C)\u2014 Met Office (@metoffice) December 29, 2014\n\nThe Met Office issued a yellow warning for ice Monday, advising that showers currently over the North Sea are expected to drift across parts of eastern England leading to icy stretches.

The Mirror reported that intelligence services had picked up internet chatter about an ISIS plot similar to the \"lone wolf\" attack on fusilier Lee Rigby. \n\nRigby was killed in May 2013 after two attackers drove a car into the soldier before brutally hacking him to death in Artillery Place, Woolwich, south-east London.\n\nThe Queen's Guards are the soldiers charged with guarding the official royal residences -- Buckingham Palace, St James's Palace, Windsor Palace, the Tower of London and the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh.\n\nAlthough they're known for their ceremonial duties and for being tourist attractions, the Queen's Guards, with their red uniforms and bearskin hats, are also fully active serving soldiers.\n\nThe changes at St James's Palace and Clarence House came last month. Guards outside Clarence House, which is the official residence of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, are now placed behind the gate for the first time since Prince Charles took up residence there, Royal Central reports. \n\nAt St James's Palace, which is the residence of several royals including the Princess Royal, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, the guards are now in the Friary Court part of the palace instead of below the Clock Tower, a more public location. \n\nBuckingham Palace is not affected as the Queen's Guards are already located behind railings there. \n\nThe threat level in the UK has been at \"severe\" since August, indicating that \"an attack is highly likely.\"\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Feminism battles, impromptu dance parties, the iPhone 6 and a pair of boxing kangaroos were some of the most shared stories on Mashable from Australia in 2014. \n\nIt was a welcome break from the biggest news stories that rocked the world in 2014, which included the disappearance of MH370, MH17 and QZ8501, the war in Ukraine, the Ebola outbreak, the Sydney siege and the Islamic State's campaign of terror.\n\nSee also: The biggest stories of 2014\n\nHere are the Australian stories that the world shared in 2014:1. TV host wore the same suit for one year, and no one noticed\n\nToday morning show host Karl Stefanovic is known Australia over for his hilarious on-air antics. Sometimes he puts the hard word on Prime Minister Tony Abbott, once he was drunk on the early morning shift and more often than not he is poking fun at his co-host Lisa Wilkinson. \n\nBut this year, he did something in honour of his much-loved screen buddy. For a whole year he decided to wear the same suit (with a couple of exceptions due to circumstance). Why? Because Wilkinson constantly comes under scrutiny from viewers regarding her outfit choices and Stefanovic had enough of the unfair treatment of women. He proved once and for all that no one gives a damn what men wear -- no one noticed his stinky blue suit, day in, day out. \n\nStefanovic's campaign to make Australians to wake up and smell his body odour hit the spot -- more than 55,000 people shared the story on social media.\n\n2. The 4 Aussie guys who will be among the world's first to get the new iPhone\n\nAustralia gets a lot of things last in life, and at a much higher premium. But there is one moment when we show the world we matter and that is by scoring the new iPhone first. Apple appreciates Down Under with its respect for time zones -- meaning it hits morning first in Australia, so we get the new products first.\n\nFour Aussie guys lined up for 10 days to get their hands on the new Apple iPhone 6, only to sell it off for the start-up company they work for. The jealousy must have made you click 'share', 'cause this story hit the 53k mark.\n\n3. 'It's not the shark's fault': Aussie teen surfer laughs after shark bites her leg\n\n13-year-old Aussie surfer Kirra-Belle Olsson had an interesting reaction to being bitten by a shark in October in Avoca, New South Wales. The teen started laughing as she demanded a friend take snapshots while she was being dragged from the water by her rescuer.\n\nShe then posted graphic photos of her bite from hospital and told the world it wasn't the shark's fault, as she had in fact stolen its wave. \n\nHer quick-thinking social media skills worked a treat, with Olsson the star of the third most shared story this year on Mashable -- with 52,000 shares.\n\n4. Game reviewer received rape threats from boys, contacted their mothers\n\nAustralian game reviewer Alanah Pearce made it clear she was the wrong person for trolls to mess with. Upon copping abuse from some teenage boys, including being told they planned to rape her, the 21-year-old came up with a nice little revenge plan: she told their parents. \n\nThe story was picked up by Reddit users and more than 47,000 readers backed Pearce's method of attack, by sharing the post on social media.\n\n5. Living on the edge: Australians design house that hangs off cliff\n\nIt seems almost 30,000 people have dreams of living in a house stuck to the side of a cliff. Aussie module-home designers Modscape imagined this insane home that could cling to a cliff above the ocean like a barnacle.\n\nThe concept was in reaction to Australians asking for a home that can fit unusual parcels of land and although it hasn't been built, with these numbers it appears tens of thousands of Aussies are interested in this vertigo-inducing abode.\n\n6. Two boxing kangaroos beat up each on suburban street in Australia\n\nNothing says 'Straya more than two marsupials smashing each other on a driveway in Aussie suburbia. 25k readers shared the video of the roos going wild on a Central Coast street. It may have reaffirmed a million stereotypes, but it was epic none-the-less and the background music made it even more legendary.\n\nFight, Skippy, fight.\n\n7. Dance party breaks out on Australian train, Monday becomes brighter\n\nSometimes the news of the day gets too much and you just have to break out and dance it off. Legend and artist Peter Sharp uses social art to encourage his audience to turn that frown upside down.\n\nIn August, he boarded a train in Fremantle, Western Australia, and broke into a high-intensity dance down the aisle. Commuters exchanged strange glances, before finally giving in to the good vibes and getting to their feet. Sharp told the train: \"I don't want money, I just want to spread a bit of happiness.\" Indeed, 23,000 people said, and clicked 'share'.\n\n8. Devastated Australian drops his new iPhone 6 on live television\n\nAussies love nothing more than giving people some stick, especially when they are the first kid to get the iPhone in Perth. Let that tall poppy syndrome kick in and laugh your head off at this poor sod who dropped his brand new iPhone on the hard, cold cement while opening it live on TV. \n\nIf that wasn't tough enough for poor Jack, 18.5k Mashable readers shared it around the world and more than five million watched the moment on YouTube, making sure this moment will haunt Jack until he is an old man.\n\n9. Uber intros surge pricing during Sydney hostage siege, then backtracks after user outcry\n\nOne of the most horrific Australian news stories of the year unfolded in Sydney on Dec. 15, as 17 people were held hostage in the Lindt Chocolate Cafe by a crazed gunman. Two hostages didn't come out alive. As the siege was being beamed around the world, Aussies were urged to leave the central business district when it was safe to do so.\n\nIn droves, they turned to Uber. Due to the sudden influx in demand, prices for Uber taxis skyrocketed, leading to anger from business workers across the city trying desperately to get home. After a story was published on Mashable, the company backtracked, offered an apology and refunded all rides but not before almost 17,000 people shared the story as they vented their anger.\n\n10. Airbnb Lets You Sleep in Ikea for the Night\n\nIt is the stuff fantasies are made of: having a sleepover in Ikea. Sleep on the freshly-made bed, eat in the fake kitchen, build random crap until your heart is content. On August 31, Airbnb made this a reality for a bunch of Australian families who won a competition. \n\n16,800 people shared this story while dreaming of a meatball dinner.\n\nSpecial mention: #PutOutYourBats: A moving Twitter tribute for cricketer Phillip Hughes\n\n#RIPPhillipHughes #putoutyourbats pic.twitter.com/qqbrtOr93A\u2014 Paul D. Taylor (@Squizabilly) November 27, 2014\n\nAlthough it didn't get the same international traction as other stories on Mashable, the emotional Twitter campaign after the sudden death of Philip Hughes, which called for Australians to place their bats outside their homes, had a deep impact on many Australians with thousands sending out tweets.\n\nHughes died just before his 26th birthday after he was hit in the neck with cricket ball while playing in a Sheffield Shield match at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 25 November 2014. It caused an outpouring of grief across the nation.\n\nHave something to add to this story?
